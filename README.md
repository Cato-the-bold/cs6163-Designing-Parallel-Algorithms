# cs6163-Designing-Parallel-Algorithms

##Project 1:
**** Search for Intelligent Puzzles ****
This project is designed to explore the bag-of-tasks model of parallel programming. 

##Project2:
Replace these MPI collective operations with an algorithm that uses point-to-point MPI calls
1) AllToAll() that performs an all-to-all communication primitives using integers, and 
2) AllToAllPersonalized() that performs the all-to-all-personalized
communication primitive using integers.

I wrote an in-place alogrithm that only process the orginal chunks, but it is still 45% lower than the standard APIs.

##Project3:
cancelled by Dr. Luke.
